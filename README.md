# Punnett square simulator for cat genetics

This is a simple Punnett square simulator for cat genetics. It allows you to input the genotypes of two parent cats and generates a Punnett square to show the possible genotypes of their offspring.

Each trait is represented by a colour, and by my convention, the dominant trait is always the darker shade of the colour. The simulator uses the following colours to represent the traits:

- Black series (B) is represented by the colour black, brown & cinnamon/light brown
- Agouti series (A) is represented by the colour green
- Dilution series (D) is represented by the colour Purple
- White spotting series (S) is represented by the colour blue
- Hair length series (L) is represented by the colour grey
  
## The simulator uses the following genetic traits:

- Fur color: Black (B) is dominant over brown (b) and cinnamon (b').
- Dilution: Normal (D) is dominant over diluted (d)
- Tabby pattern: Agouti (A) is dominant over non-agouti (a)
- White spotting: White spotting (S) is dominant over no white spotting (s)
- Short hair (L) is dominant over long hair (l)

## Architecture

The simulator should be a web application that can run purely in the browser. It should be built using HTML, CSS, and typescript. The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
The application should be able to run on any modern web browser without the need for any additional plugins or software. The application should be able to run offline and should not require an internet connection to function.
The application should be able to save the user's input and settings locally, so that they can be retrieved later. The application should be able to generate a Punnett square based on the user's input and display it in a clear and easy-to-understand format. The application should be able to generate a list of possible genotypes for the offspring based on the user's input.

## Road map

The application should be able to generate a list of possible phenotypes for the offspring based on the user's input.
